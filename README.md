# Run Finder App
An app that helps a person find what run they can do when they know certain milage or time requirements, as well as(in the future) schedule runs for the future and  map runs in the app itself. 

The only files that have my code in them are in the lib folder, or pubspec.yaml(where I essentially imported packages).
